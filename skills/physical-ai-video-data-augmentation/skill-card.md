## Description: <br>
Use when running video data augmentation and auto-labeling workflows on OSMO: flow selection, preflight, submit-time interpolation, monitoring, and output retrieval. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
CC-BY-4.0 AND Apache-2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers use this skill to orchestrate end-to-end video data augmentation and auto-labeling pipelines on NVIDIA OSMO, generating labeled synthetic training data for physical-AI perception models. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`claude-code`) <br>
- Codex (`codex`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 17 internal evaluation tasks (13 positive skill-activation, 4 negative) with 2 attempts per task and a 50% pass threshold. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies that the agent loaded the expected skill and workflow. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Checks routing quality, decoy avoidance, and redundant tool usage. <br>
- `accuracy`: Grades final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Checks whether the overall user task completed successfully. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies expected behavior steps, including safety expectations. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Compares token usage with and without the skill. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Dimension | Num | `claude-code` | `codex` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Security | 8 | 100% (+0%) | 91% (+0%) |
| Correctness | 8 | 81% (+0%) | 77% (-3%) |
| Discoverability | 8 | 73% (+6%) | 68% (-3%) |
| Effectiveness | 8 | 72% (-3%) | 70% (-4%) |
| Efficiency | 8 | 68% (+6%) | 60% (-5%) |
