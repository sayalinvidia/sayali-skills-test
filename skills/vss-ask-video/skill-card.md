## Description: <br>
Use to ask the VSS agent's video_understanding tool a fresh visual question about a recorded clip. Not for prior tool output, search hits, or metadata-answerable questions. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache-2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers use this skill to ask visual questions about recorded video clips, leveraging the VSS agent's video_understanding tool for VLM-based inference on video frames. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
NVSkills-Eval 3-Tier Evaluation (external profile); Tier 1 static validation (9 checks, 13 findings), Tier 2 deduplication (2 checks, 0 findings). Overall verdict: PASS. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
