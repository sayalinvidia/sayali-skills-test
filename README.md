Skills are portable instruction sets that teach AI agents how to use NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries, AI Blueprints, and platform tools correctly. From solving vehicle routing problems with cuOpt, to deploying RAG pipelines, to onboarding models into TensorRT-LLM, every skill listed here is **published and verified by NVIDIA**.

This repository is a **catalog** — skills are maintained in their respective product repos and mirrored here daily via an automated sync pipeline. It follows the open [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), making skills compatible with any AI agent or framework that supports the standard.

We are building this in the open. The catalog, sync pipeline, and roadmap are public so the community can see what we ship, what we plan to ship, and how we secure skills for use. As we add signing, scanning, and evaluation, each improvement lands here incrementally.

---

## Quickstart

Browse the [Available Skills](#available-skills) table below, then install directly from this repo — every skill is mirrored here under `skills/`:

```bash
# Example: install the cuOpt LP/MILP skill
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/NVIDIA/skills.git
cd skills && git sparse-checkout set skills/cuopt/cuopt-lp-milp-api-python
cp -r skills/cuopt/cuopt-lp-milp-api-python ~/.claude/skills/
```

That's it — the skill activates automatically the next time your agent encounters a relevant task. For example, ask your agent to "solve a linear programming problem with cuOpt" and the skill guides it through the cuOpt Python API.

### Install by Agent

| Agent / Framework | Installation |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Claude Code | Copy the skill directory into `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Codex | Copy the skill directory into your project's `.codex/skills/` folder |
| Cursor | Copy the skill directory into your project's `.cursor/skills/` folder |
| Other agents | Copy the skill directory into your agent's skills folder |

## Standards & Compatibility

This repository adheres to the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification):

- Skills are portable directories with a `SKILL.md` file at their root.
- Metadata uses YAML frontmatter with required `name` and `description` fields.
- Skills follow a progressive disclosure model — lightweight metadata loads at startup, full instructions load on activation.
- Validate your skill using the [`skills-ref`](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/tree/main/skills-ref) reference library.
